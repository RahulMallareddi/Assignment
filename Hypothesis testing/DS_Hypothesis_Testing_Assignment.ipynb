    "### Background:\n",
    "Bombay hospitality Ltd. operates a franchise model for producing exotic Norwegian dinners throughout New England. The operating cost for a franchise in a week (W) is given by the equation W = $1,000 + $5X, where X represents the number of units produced in a week. Recent feedback from restaurant owners suggests that this cost model may no longer be accurate, as their observed weekly operating costs are higher.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective:\n",
    "To investigate the restaurant owners' claim about the increase in weekly operating costs using hypothesis testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Provided:\n",
    "\n",
    " - The theoretical weekly operating cost model: W = $1,000 + $5X\n",
    " - Sample of 25 restaurants with a mean weekly cost of Rs. 3,050\n",
    " - Number of units produced in a week (X) follows a normal distribution with a mean (μ) of 600 units and a standard deviation (σ) of 25 units\n"

    "Alternative Hypothesis (Ha): There is an increase in weekly operating costs. (μ > 4000)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a right-tailed test because the alternative hypothesis is looking for an increase in the average monthly revenue, which indicates an improvement."
